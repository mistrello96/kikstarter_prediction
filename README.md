# KickstarterPrediction
A university project to apply what studied in Data Tecchnology and Machine Learning course.
We first made some integration and cleaning tasks on datasets from kikstarter, representing data concerning the number of failded/succesfull campaigns.
With the datset we obtained from the previous process, we applied some ML models to find out which of them can achieve the best performance
